# Simple RustyApp Docker

This repository contains a Dockerized Rust web application that demonstrates a simple setup for running a Rust-based web app. The app is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it ideal for deployment in containerized environments.

## Features

- **Powered by Rust**: Utilizes the Rust programming language for fast and reliable performance.
- **Dockerized**: Prebuilt Docker images for easy deployment.
- **Minimal Configuration**: Simple setup to get started quickly.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Compatible with x86_64 and arm64 architectures (e.g., macOS M1).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lezgend/simple-rustyapp-docker.git && cd simple-rustyapp-docker
```

### Pull the Docker Image

For x86_64 architecture:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/lezgend/simple-rustyapp-docker:v1.0.0
```

For arm64 architecture (e.g., macOS M1/M2):
```bash
docker pull --platform linux/arm64 ghcr.io/lezgend/simple-rustyapp-docker:v1.0.0
```

### Run the Application

Start the container using Docker:
```bash
docker run -p 8000:80 ghcr.io/lezgend/simple-rustyapp-docker:v1.0.0
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Building Locally

Follow these steps to build and run the Docker image locally.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) is installed on your system.

### Steps to Build and Run
